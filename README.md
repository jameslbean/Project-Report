# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Titanic dataset using data visualization and statistical methods. The analysis includes several visualizations tools and a chi-square test to explore relationships within the data.

## Features

1. **Histogram of Age**: Displays the distribution of passengers' ages to highlight demographics.
2. **Pie Chart of Survival Distribution**: Visualizes the proportion of passengers who survived versus those who did not.
3. **Scatter Plot with Linear Regression (Fare vs. Pclass)**: Analyzes the relationship between passenger class and fare, including a fitted regression line to illustrate trends.
4. **Bar Chart of Embarkation Ports**: Shows the number of passengers who embarked from each port (Southampton, Cherbourg, and Queenstown).
5. **Contingency Table and Chi-Square Test**: Compares survival rates across passenger classes, providing insights into the significance of the relationship between survival and class.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

## Usage

1. Download the files.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Run the script to generate visualizations and statistical analyses.
